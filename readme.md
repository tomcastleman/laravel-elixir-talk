# Laravel Elixir for any project

- London VueJS Meetup, Thursday 7th July 2016

## Abstract

_Not a webpack ninja?_ [Laravel Elixir](https://github.com/laravel/elixir)
makes a great front-end build system which just works out the box with little
or no configuration.

We will start with basic introductions and in this very simple demo project,
a firewall editor app, move on to cover a range of features including Vue
template compilation, asset combination & versioning, and browser sync to give
you ideas for how to structure your Vue projects and workflow.

_Not ready for vuex?_ Regardless of your backend stack (but using PHP examples),
we'll take look at simple techniques for reading and writing data to / from your
frontend.

## Instructions

```
➜  ~ node -v
